The Conversation Radar Agent scans public communities and professional networks to find threads where your team can positively shape AI-visible narratives. It prioritizes discussions that map to your tracked prompts, brand mentions, and competitor coverage so you can respond with context that models are likely to ingest and reuse.

---

## What it looks for

- Public forums and communities (for example, Reddit)
- Professional networks (for example, LinkedIn posts or comments)
- Threads that mention your brand or competitors
- Conversations tied to tracked prompts and problems
- High-signal posts with strong engagement or authority

---

## How it helps your AI visibility

- Surface conversations where you can inject accurate, high-quality context about your product
- Share resources and pages you want AI models to associate with specific problems
- Build relationships and mentions in places AI is likely to crawl and learn from

Over time, this influences:

- Which sources models cite in answers
- How models describe your brand and competitors
- Your Share of Voice for key prompts

---

## Why it matters

The agent delivers a ranked list of opportunities to join discussions that AI models repeatedly cite. By engaging early and with strong references, you shape the narratives models reuse, improve downstream AI referred traffic, and raise the authority of your domain across your tracked prompts.
