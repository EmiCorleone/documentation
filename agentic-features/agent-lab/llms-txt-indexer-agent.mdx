description: "The LLMS.TXT Agent is an autonomous backend agent inside Agent Lab that generates and maintains a high-signal /llms.txt (and optionally /llms-full.txt) for your site. Its job is simple: turn your website into a compact, LLM-friendly index that makes it easier for AI models to understand, navigate, and cite your content."

## What problem does the LLMS.TXT Agent solve?

Models increasingly rely on live web data, but:

- HTML is noisy and bloated  
- Context windows are limited  
- Important pages (pricing, docs, API, legal, product) are often buried

Without a structured index, models may:

- Miss your most important pages  
- Misinterpret your pricing or product structure  
- Overweight low-value content or outdated posts

The LLMS.TXT Agent fixes this by maintaining a **compressed, opinionated map of your site** that models can read in one shot.

## How the agent works

1) **Crawls and analyzes your site**  
   Uses Mudra’s internal map of your content surface.

2) **Selects and prioritizes URLs**  
   Focuses on pages that:
   - map to tracked prompts,
   - carry strong structured data,
   - or are strategically important for AI visibility.

3) **Generates or updates `llms.txt`**  
   Proposes additions, removals, or reorganizations of the index.

4) **Ships changes safely**  
   Depending on your setup, the agent can:
   - Create suggestions inside Mudra,
   - Open a GitHub pull request with changes,
   - Or integrate with your deployment process.
