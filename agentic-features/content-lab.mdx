Content Lab is Mudra's workspace for turning **tracked prompts** into **citation-ready pages**. It takes the sources AI models already cite, adds fresh research, and ships a structured article that's easy for models to quote.

## What it is

- **Prompt-aligned:** Every page starts from a tracked prompt (or cluster) you care about.
- **Source-aware:** Uses the same domains/URLs AI models cite, not random web pages.
- **Structured for models:** One clear H1, logical H2/H3s, short paragraphs, optional schema suggestions.

When you open Content Lab for a prompt, Mudra:

1. Runs that prompt across supported AI models.
2. Captures their answers and cited sources (domains + URLs).
3. Uses those sources plus fresh research to build a better, more complete answer on your domain.

No diffing against your existing pages — the goal is a **stronger, clearer version** of what models already try to answer.

## How it works (behind the scenes)

1. **Ingest sources**
   - Pulls the citations tied to the tracked prompt.
   - Filters and deduplicates; keeps up to 10; needs at least 2 to proceed.

2. **Scrape sources (Firecrawl)**
   - Grabs the main content from each URL (markdown + links).
   - Keeps going even if some URLs fail; stops only if fewer than 2 succeed.

3. **Gap analysis**
   - Compares scraped content against the tracked prompt.
   - Flags missing angles, data gaps, weak formats, and suggests search queries.

4. **Live research**
   - Runs focused searches (recent data, original studies, expert quotes).
   - Adds a small set of additional sources with key insights.

5. **Draft generation**
   - Produces a 1,200–1,600 word article with:
     - One H1 and direct-answer H2s
     - TL;DR right under the title
     - Short paragraphs (2–4 sentences, 50–75 words)
     - Comparison table when the prompt is comparative
     - Bottom Line + FAQ (3–5 Q&As)
   - Includes author name/title from the brand profile and tracks word count, sections, and sources.

Result: A complete, GEO-optimized article saved to your campaigns with all sources (scraped + research) logged.

## What you see in the UI

- **Step 1:** Pick content type (Blog Post today; other formats next).
- **Step 2:** Pick the tracked prompt (by category or list).
- **Step 3:** Pick the target audience/ICP.
- **Step 4:** Review & toggle citation sources (needs at least 2).
- **Step 5:** Watch generation progress (validate → scrape → analyze gaps → research → draft).
- Auto-redirects to the campaign page when ready.

## What it produces

- **Core article / pillar page** — Direct answer to the tracked prompt with clear sections.
- **Supporting Q&As** — FAQ blocks aligned to how users and models split the topic.
- **Research-enriched sections** — Uses primary studies, reports, and fresh data instead of generic claims.
- **Schema-ready structure** — Headings, FAQs, tables, and lists that are predictable for models.
- **Saved campaign** — Article, metadata (title, sections, word count, author), and all sources tracked.

## How the agents help

- **Content Quality agent:** Enforces clear titles, upfront answers, evidence-backed claims, and E-E-A-T signals.
- **Content Structure agent:** Keeps the heading hierarchy clean, paragraphs short, and suggests tables/lists/FAQs.
- **Citation & Research agent:** Spots claims that need proof, pulls recent high-authority sources, and keeps citations tidy.

You keep final voice and accuracy; agents handle the heavy lifting so the draft is safe to cite and easy to reuse.

## What to prepare before you start

- The tracked prompt (or cluster) you want to win.
- At least **2 citation sources** tied to that prompt (auto-loaded if available).
- Brand profile basics: brand name, description, target ICP, unique value prop, author name/title.
- Optional: Any non-public data or examples you want woven in (you can paste them into the prompt context).

## Why it matters

- You publish pages that **match how models already answer** — with better depth, fresher data, and clearer structure.
- Every section is designed to be **quotable and scannable** by AI models.
- Sources are tracked, research is fresh, and output is ready for GEO-focused distribution.
