## GitHub Integration

The GitHub integration lets Mudra’s agents ship changes to your codebase via pull requests instead of manual work.

This is especially useful for:

- Updating `llms.txt` or related AI-facing files
- Adding or adjusting structured data (schema)
- Making small technical tweaks that support AI visibility

You stay in control of review and deployment; Mudra provides the proposed changes.

## Prerequisites

To use the GitHub integration, you will need:

- A GitHub account
- A repository that backs your site (for example, your Next.js or other web framework repo)
- Permission to install and authorize the Mudra GitHub app

---

## Setup

1. In Mudra, go to **Integrations → GitHub**.
2. Click **Connect GitHub**.
3. Follow the authorization flow:
   - Select the organization and repository you want to connect.
   - Confirm the requested permissions (typically limited to creating pull requests).
4. Save the configuration.

Once connected, you can choose which agents are allowed to open PRs and for which repo(s).

---

## Security and access

Mudra only needs the minimal scopes required to:

- Read repository contents
- Create branches and pull requests

It does not merge PRs automatically.
