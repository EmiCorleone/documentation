# AI Referral Traffic

AI Referred Traffic helps you understand how much of your traffic is influenced by AI. Mudra gives you a way to track traffic that likely originates from AI answers and assistants.

## What counts as AI Referred Traffic?

AI Referred Traffic is an estimate of visits that:

- Start or are heavily influenced by an interaction with an AI model, and eventually arrive on your site.

**Set up:** Add our lightweight script to your site’s head to start measuring the amount of human referral traffic influenced by AI models.

It is not a perfect, low-level “referrer” field. Instead, it’s a **directional signal** to answer:

> “As we improve AI visibility and structure, are we also seeing more visits that look like they are coming from AI-driven discovery?”

## Why it matters

AI visibility without traffic is just a vanity metric. AI Referred Traffic helps you:

- Connect visibility and structure improvements to actual visits.
- Compare traffic before and after major changes (new content, agents, or technical fixes).
