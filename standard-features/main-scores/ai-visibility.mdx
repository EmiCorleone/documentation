## What is it?

The **AI Visibility Score** tells you how often your brand is mentioned by AI models for the prompts you care about. At its core, it’s a simple ratio:

> Out of all the prompts we asked, in how many did your company get mentioned?

---

## Formula

For a given project and scan:

- **Prompts mentioned** = number of tracked prompts where your brand appears in the AI answer
- **Prompts queried** = total number of tracked prompts we ran in that scan

The score is:

$\text{AI Visibility} = \frac{\text{Prompts mentioned}}{\text{Prompts queried}} \times 100$

This produces a value between **0 and 100**.

---

## Example

- Prompts queried: `40`
- Prompts mentioned: `22`

$\text{AI Visibility} = \frac{22}{40} \times 100 = 55$

In this case, your AI Visibility Score is **55**, which means your brand shows up in **55%** of the questions you told Mudra to care about.

## How to read it

- **0–20** – You’re largely invisible for your tracked prompts.
- **20–60** – You show up sometimes, but inconsistently or only in certain areas.
- **60–90** – You’re present for most key prompts; work on position and quality.
- **90+** – You’re almost always mentioned; focus shifts to rank, sentiment, and Share of Voice.

> AI Visibility doesn’t say *where* you appear in answers (that’s **Average Position** and **Deep Track Prompts view**) or how you compare to competitors (that’s **Share of Voice**). It answers a simpler yes/no question: **“Do we show up at all when it matters?”**
