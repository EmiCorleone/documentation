## What is it?

The **Average Position** score tells you *where* your brand tends to appear in AI answers when it is mentioned. While **AI Visibility** answers “Do we show up at all?”, Average Position answers:

> “When we do show up, how high or low are we in the answer?”

Lower is better:
- `1` means you’re usually mentioned first.
- `3` means you’re usually around third.
- Higher numbers mean you appear later in the answer.

## How Average Position is calculated (per prompt)

For each **tracked prompt**, Mudra:
1. Runs the prompt across multiple AI providers (for example: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity).
2. Keeps only responses where your brand is mentioned and a position has been assigned (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.).
3. Collects the list of positions, like: `positions = [2, 4, 3]`
4. Computes the average of those positions:

$\text{Average Position (for this prompt)} = \frac{\text{sum of positions}}{\text{number of positions}}$

If your brand is **not mentioned** in any provider for that prompt, the Average Position for that prompt is not available.

## Example: Average Position for one prompt

Prompt:
> “Best AI platforms for marketing automation?”

You run this prompt on 4 providers and get:

| Provider   | Brand mentioned? | Position |
| ---        | ---              | ---      |
| ChatGPT    | Yes              | 2        |
| Claude     | Yes              | 4        |
| Gemini     | No               | —        |
| Perplexity | Yes              | 3        |

Step by step:
- Keep only providers where your brand was mentioned: `positions = [2, 4, 3]`
- Sum: `2 + 4 + 3 = 9`
- Count: `3`
- Average Position:

$\text{Average Position} = \frac{9}{3} = 3.0$

Result: For this prompt, your **Average Position is `3.0`**. Whenever you are mentioned, you appear **around third** on average. If none of the providers had mentioned you, the Average Position for this prompt would be not available.

## Overall Average Position (across prompts)

Mudra also shows an **overall Average Position** for the project.

To compute it, Mudra:
1. First computes **Average Position per prompt** (as above).
2. Builds a list of **valid** averages (ignoring prompts with empty referencing): $[\text{avg\_pos}_1, \text{avg\_pos}_2, \dots, \text{avg\_pos}_n]$
3. Computes the average of those values:

$\text{Overall Average Position} = \frac{\text{sum of valid prompt averages}}{\text{number of prompts with a valid average}}$

If **all** prompts are `null` (your brand is never mentioned), the Overall Average Position is also `null`.
