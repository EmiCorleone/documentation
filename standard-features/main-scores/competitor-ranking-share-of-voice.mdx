The **Share of Voice (SOV)** ranking shows how much “AI airtime” each company gets compared to everyone else in your space, **including you**.

It answers:

> “Out of all the brand mentions across our tracked prompts, how much belongs to us vs each competitor?”

We always include **your brand** in this calculation, even if you have **0%**, so you can see your real position in the market.

## How Share of Voice is calculated

We look at mentions across **all tracked prompts** and **all providers**.

For each company (your brand + every competitor):

1. **Count mentions**
   - `Company Mentions` = how many times that company is mentioned in the results across all prompts/providers.
2. **Calculate total mentions**
   - `Total Mentions` = sum of mentions for **your brand + all competitors**.
3. **Compute Share of Voice**

$\text{Company Share of Voice} = \frac{\text{Company Mentions}}{\text{Total Mentions}} \times 100$

This is done for **every** company (you + all competitors). Then we sort the companies from highest to lowest Share of Voice to build the **Competitor Rankings** table.

> If your brand has 0 mentions, you still appear in the table with 0%, at the bottom of the ranking.

## How to read it

- **Top of table (high %)** – You dominate the AI conversation for these prompts; focus on defending position and improving sentiment.
- **Middle of table (mid %)** – You share the stage; target prompts/providers where you lag to win incremental share.
- **Bottom of table (low % or 0%)** – You’re rarely mentioned; prioritize coverage for critical prompts so you at least enter the conversation.

## Why it matters

- **Market reality check** – Shows your true AI footprint versus peers on the prompts you track.
- **Opportunity targeting** – Highlights which competitors and prompts to attack to gain quick SOV wins.
- **Trend tracking** – Watch your SOV move after new content or agent deployments.
