## What does the Natural Language Report achieve?

Instead of digging through complex metrics, your team gets a written overview that highlights the most important shifts in AI visibility, structure, traffic, and agent activity.

## What the report includes

Each report typically covers:

1. **Score deltas and trends**
   - Where you improved, where you dropped, and any notable outliers.

2. **Agent activity**
   - Files or structured data updated
   - New `llms.txt` entries
   - Content or opportunities surfaced

3. **AI Referred Traffic insights**
   - How AI-driven traffic evolved in the same period, so you can tie visibility and infra changes to potential impact.

## How often you receive it

The frequency of the Natural Language Report depends on your plan (for example, every 3 days, weekly or monthly). Each report covers the period since the last one, so you always see changes in context instead of as isolated numbers.

The Natural Language Report keeps AI search from becoming a black box by turning raw measurements into a narrative your whole team can act on.
